This package provides some useful tools for ImageJ and Fiji. To install, drag the .jar file located in "dist" to your ImageJ or Fiji plugins folder.

Custom Legend: Design a legend in an independent window using a LUT of your choice and to your own specifications. This plugin is an extension of the Calibration Bar functionality.

Selection To Indices: Converts a 2D ImageJ ROI to index numbers. Enables quick transferring of an ImageJ selection to a Matlab index vector.

Indices to Selection: Converts a Matlab index vector to an ImageJ ROI. Note that the ROI will be a cloud of independent points.

False Discovery Rate: Enables pixel-wise statistical testing, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER).
